        <span class="kuikly-close">&times;</span>
        <p>This is a modal window!</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

Cards can be created as follows:

```html
<div class="kuikly-card">
    <img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="Card Image">
    <h2>Card Title</h2>
    <p>Some text about the card.</p>
</div>
```

## Customization
